# Falke

This is a test for one of my projects. It is meant to test my knowledge about data analysis with industrial focus.

However simple, it is the start for what I will call **Falke**, an industrial data collector focused on production data.  
The main goal of the project is to gather:

- Total production data
- Defect rates
- Downtime analysis
- OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) calculation

This will allow managers and companies to better understand what‚Äôs really going on in their production lines.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

If the frontend feels a bit off ‚Äî forgive me. I'm a backend dev venturing into the JavaScript wilderness. Feedback is welcome and appreciated.
