This is a test for one of my projects. It is meant to test my knowledge about data analysis with industrial focus.
However simple, it is the start for what I will call "Falke", an industrial data collector focused on production data. The main focus of the project will be to get total production data, defects rate, downtime analysis and OEE calculus, thus allowing managers and companies to better understand the processes ocurring in their own production line.
The languages and tools used in the main project will be:
- Rust
- Elixir
- Julia
- Python
- React
- Tauri
If the frontend is a bit strange, I must apologise for I am not as skilled in frontend languages as in backend ones (Using .js was an experience to me). feel free to criticise and tell me what could be improved, for constructive feedback is always welcomed.
